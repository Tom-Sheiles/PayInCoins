- All values needed are prime numbers
- including 1 and the final value to be calculated
- Calculate the total number of ways a given amount can be payed using prime coins

e.g. 5 can be payed in 6 ways. one 5 coin, 2+3, 1+1+3, 1+2+2, 1+1+2, 1+1+1+1+1 

- inputs:
	1 int: money payed using all possible combinations
	2 ints: money to be payed and number of coins that can be used
	3 ints: money to be payed and then the range of values that should be used
	
- output.txt should contain the number of coins needed for each value

- must be able to be run on the command line passing the path for input.txt
- must produce a powerpoint describing your algorithm
